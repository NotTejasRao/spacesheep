# SpaceSheep
_A sprite-based 3D game created at Bellevue College's 2017 Global Game Jam._

You tried to colonize another planet. The planet had sheeps. They seemed fine. They are not. They get REALLY upset at night. 

Collect uranium ores every night to maintain communication with mothership OR die.
